AceTree open source imaging analysis software from Starrynite project



AceTree developers prefer the IntelliJ IDE, though Eclipse and others can also be used.

**NOTE instructions for setting up IDE projects etc for each of the Bao lab software packages can be found in the top level git repository Developer Documentation. 

AceTree requires JRE 8 and uses the java compiler version 1.8.

We encourage and welcome changes to the codebase. For information about setting up the project, navigating the codebase or anything else, contact Anthony Santella santella@mskcc.org.

As a historical note sample data and combined starrynite Acetreee distributions of various historical vintages can still be found on the original project website: http://starrynite.sourceforge.net/
However this git is the current actively developed version and prior versions should be used only if it is necessary to replicate historical results.
